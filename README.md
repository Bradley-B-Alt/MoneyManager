# MoneyManager
[Teaching Tools]  Handles money operations for a Cashier and Cash Register. Example solution to a challenge. See below. 

BAKE SALE CHALLENGE
You are working the register at a robotics bake sale for three days, where all items
are less than $1, but can be any value from 1 cent to 100 cents (inclusive).

DAY 1:
You decide to write a program to help you with your job. 
Write a program to tell you the optimal change (least number of coins) to give back to a customer
when they pay. 

DAY 2:
You realize that your program is requesting operations on coins that do not exist in the register.
Keep track of all the money currently in the register, and do not complete the operation if the coins do not exist. (Ex. you have 2 quarters and the program wants you to give back 3) 
Instead of completing the operation, print a string to the console saying "Not enough x", where x is the coin that you do not have enough of. You will want to create a separate class for the register.

DAY 3:
Five minutes before the bake sale starts, your fellow robotics members inform you they will not be able to make it to their jobs at their registers. There are 5 registers. 
Write a program to manage the registers for them. You should be able to specify the register and value, and the program will make change and subtract it from that register.
